In this project, I built models: 1 is a statefull RNN and 1 is a stateless RNN.
Then I trained them using the data from the movies reviews dataset (Positive and negative.)
After that, both models were made to predict the next 100 characters after being given 1 starting character ("a", "s" or "t").

The project is written in Python.
Please extract the compressed file in \data\negative and \data\positive before running the code.
